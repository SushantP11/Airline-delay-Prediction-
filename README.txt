                              AIM OF THE RESEARCH

The main motto of this project is to achieve a reliable delay prediction model which can predict flight delay and help in reducing the losses which are the effecting the flight operations. Also, try to study factors which might not be significant in previous researches and compare them with modern day problems. 


                                OBJECTIVES 

1. To study the data which is available and is an open-source version.
2. To understand what are the necessary attributes which are significant.
3. To clean the data by analysing necessary aspects of it, understand attributes which play an important role in delay, and to neglect factors which do not have significance with flight delay. 
4. To prepare the data which would be used for Processing at which the information is exposed to different means and strategies for specialized controls utilizing Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms to produce a yield or understanding about the information.
5. To visualize the obtained output and make necessary observations and derive conclusions.



FOLLOW THE STEPS AND COMMENTS IN R CODE.
